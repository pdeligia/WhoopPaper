%\textsc{Whoop} is currently working on an unmodified network device driver (the RealTek r8169 which is part of the official Linux kernel distribution). Our immediate future work includes applying invariant generation to tame the effect of our coarse over-approximation. We also plan to introduce counterexample feasibility checking to evaluate if a reported bug is real or spurious. Towards this, we plan to feed a counterexample generated by \textsc{Whoop} into a precise bug finder, such as Corral~\cite{lal2012corral}, which will be guided only to execution paths that may manifest the bug, to either confirm it or discard it as a false positive.
