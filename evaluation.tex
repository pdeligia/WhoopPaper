\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{eval:setup}

We conducted all experiments on ... We use the following software versions: Z3 4.1; SMACK 1.4; Clang/LLVM 3.5; \corral commit 3aa62d7425b5; Boogie commit d6a7f2bd79c9.

\subsection{Benchmarks}
\label{eval:benchmarks}

We evaluate our methodology against 10 modules taken from the Linux kernel (currently a mix of latest and older distributions).

\subsection{Granularity of Yield Instrumentation}
\label{eval:granularity}

We evaluate the scalability of our acceleration technique with respect to our benchmark sets.

Granularities: Yield-All (\corral without \whoop); \yieldcoarse; \yieldmr

The machzwd watchdog driver explodes when running on vanilla \corral, because in some entry point pairs it attempts to analyse a large number of memory regions. For example for the entry point pair write vs init, it instruments interleavings at 26 different memory regions in a single invocation of \corral, which required approximately 1000 seconds to analyse. The same entry point pair is found race-free by \whoop. Using this information in \corral with the \yieldmr instrumentation, the pair takes less than a second to analyse. The \yieldcoarse instrumentation does not perform as well, because it works in the binary granularity of racy or non-racy entry points.

Our experiments used the default \corral context switch bound \texttt{/k:2}. A higher context switch bound would result into deeper interleavings being explored and thus a larger sequentialised program. Intuitively, this means that we would see even greater speedups using information from \whoop, when exploring deeper interleavings. \PDComment{We should take a few measurements with higher k -- no need to be in the table -- just to verify this argument.}
