The machzwd watchdog driver explodes when running on vanilla \corral, because in some entry point pairs it attempts to analyse a large number of memory regions. For example for the entry point pair write vs init, it instruments interleavings at 26 different memory regions in a single invocation of \corral, which required approximately 1000 seconds to analyse. The same entry point pair is found race-free by \whoop. Using this information in \corral with the \yieldmr instrumentation, the pair takes less than a second to analyse. The \yieldcoarse instrumentation does not perform as well, because it works in the binary granularity of racy or non-racy entry points.
